Multitask Deep Learning for Depth Estimation and Object Classification

Monocular depth estimation, the process of extracting a pixel-wise depth map from a single RGB image, is a commonly studied problem in deep learning. We aim to investigate transfer learning strategies for depth estimation and object classification. Importantly, we train on Redwood 3D Scan, a dataset featuring commonly encountered objects collected by civilians equipped with RGB-D cameras; we feature a simpler, easier model for non-ideal, real-world environments. We hope it will be useful for everyday cases where complete knowledge of the surrounding objects is crucial.
